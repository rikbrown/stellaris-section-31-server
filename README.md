# stellaris-section-31-server

Server for Section 31, a Stellaris save-game analyser for fun stats.

This is **totally** WIP, but basically designed ultimately as a way to get cool Civ-like statistics at end-of-game for Stellaris
for the games I play with my friend. I said it was esoteric, right?

Depends on my parser of Stellaris saves, [klausewitz-parser](https://github.com/rikbrown/klausewitz-parser).

Used by [stellaris-section-31-app](https://github.com/rikbrown/stellaris-section-31-app).
